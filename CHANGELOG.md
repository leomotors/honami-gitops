# Changelog

Version 1 is implemented without Docker. (Git Clone and systemctl service) which is quite painful to maintain.

There is no versioning before 2.0.0 so the changelog is not here.

## [2.1.0] - 2025-12-26

- docs: update docs for endpoints
- only allow webhooks part from external

## [2.0.4] - 2025-12-09

- refactor to docker image
- fastify -> elysia
